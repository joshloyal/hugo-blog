<p>This is the launch of the blog on my personal site. I am still not sure what this blog will contain. In fact, I am starting this blog to develop my writing voice and style. However, I know that it will primarily be a place I can expand on ideas relevant to my research and work interests. So expect to read a lot of musings on statistical concepts, data science topics, coding tricks, software libraries, and current trends in machine learning.</p>
<p>When I started learning statistics and data science, I found reading peopleâ€™s blogs crucial to my learning experience. They offered an applied and down-to-earth look at concepts that seemed very disconnected and boring when presented in a textbook. Often times I could take the information in a blog post and apply it to a problem I was working on. Or I would come across an explanation of a topic that was clearer than the textbook I had been reading. For that reason, I love blogs. I think they are fundamental to the expansion of ideas outside of academic circles. I hope the content of this blog is useful to others, and I am excited to see what comes of it!</p>
